## 🚀 Setup Instructions  

1. **Clone this repository**  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/random-forest-project.git
   cd random-forest-project

Install dependencies

pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib


Launch Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook


Open the notebook

Navigate to code.ipynb in your browser.

🛠️ Usage

Load data

By default, the notebook uses data.csv.

To use another dataset, update the file path in the notebook.

Run cells sequentially

Preprocess → Train → Evaluate.

Modify hyperparameters

Tune Random Forest parameters such as:

n_estimators (number of trees)

max_depth (tree depth)

random_state (reproducibility)

Visualize results (optional)

Feature importance plots

Confusion matrices (for classification)

Regression error curves

📊 Data Description

Input Files:

data.csv → Main dataset

data-1758727337984.csv → Backup/secondary dataset

Format:

CSV with headers

Columns = features (input variables) + target (output variable)

Note:

Clean and preprocess your dataset before running the model for best results.

🌲 Random Forest Overview

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that:

Builds multiple decision trees on random subsets of data.

Aggregates predictions (majority vote for classification, mean for regression).

Advantages:
✔ Works well with large and high-dimensional datasets
✔ Less prone to overfitting than a single decision tree
✔ Provides feature importance scores for interpretability

🔧 Customization

You can customize this project for your own use cases:

Replace data.csv with your own dataset.

Add preprocessing (normalization, missing value handling, encoding).

Experiment with feature engineering.

Implement additional evaluation metrics (e.g., ROC-AUC, RMSE).

📌 Example Output

After running the notebook, you can expect outputs like:

Accuracy Score (Classification):

Model Accuracy: 92.4%


Confusion Matrix (Classification):


Feature Importance (Visualization):


(Tip: Create an assets/ folder in your repo and add generated plots/screenshots for better presentation.)
