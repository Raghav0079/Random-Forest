## Overview

This project implements a Random Forest algorithm for data analysis and prediction. It includes code, sample data, and instructions for running and understanding the model.

## Project Structure

- `code.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the main code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `data.csv`: Main dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `data-1758727337984.csv`: Additional or backup dataset (purpose may vary).

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Python dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib
   ```

2. **Open the notebook:**

   - Launch Jupyter Notebook:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

   - Open `code.ipynb` in your browser.

## Usage

1. **Load the data:**

   - The notebook reads from `data.csv` by default. You can change the file path in the notebook if needed.

2. **Run the cells:**

   - Execute each cell in order to preprocess data, train the Random Forest model, and evaluate its performance.

3. **Modify parameters:**

   - You can adjust Random Forest parameters (e.g., number of trees, max depth) in the notebook to experiment with model performance.

## Data Description

- `data.csv` and `data-1758727337984.csv` should be CSV files with appropriate headers.
- Typical columns might include features (input variables) and a target (output variable for prediction).
- Ensure your data is clean and formatted correctly for best results.

## Random Forest Algorithm

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their results for more accurate and stable predictions. It is widely used for both classification and regression tasks.

**Advantages:**

- Handles large datasets with higher dimensionality.
- Reduces overfitting compared to single decision trees.
- Provides feature importance scores.

## Customization

- Replace `data.csv` with your own dataset as needed.
- Modify the notebook to include additional preprocessing, feature engineering, or evaluation metrics.
